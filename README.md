# Galvanize Q1 Project
###### By: _Christian Taggart_


### A Virtual Reality tour of Galvanizes Walnut Campus in Boulder, CO

##### Made With:
- Mozilla A-Frame (WebVR platform)
- HTML 5
- Javascript
  - JQuery
- MagicaVoxel
  - I created all the elements of the scene aside from the Backroung video in MagicaVoxel.

Mozillas A-Frame was a pleasure to work with. Their on line Dev tools and Docs were very easy to understand and use.


## Controls:

- W = Forward
- A = Strafe Left
- S =  Backward
- D = Strafe Right
- SpaceBar =  Jump
- X = Return to ground
